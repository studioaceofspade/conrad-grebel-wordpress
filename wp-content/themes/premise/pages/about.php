                    <p>It's one thing to talk about being different, and another to let you experience it! Since 2002, Conrad Grebel has been crafting and building furniture centered around design inspirations from all across North America.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here is what you can expect from your Conrad Grebel experience...</p>
                    
                    <h2>Handcrafted, Made In The USA Construction</h2>
                    <p>We use time-honored techniques to join and finish our furniture, which you can see pictured here below.</p>
                    <img class="center" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/wood.jpg" alt="Our top-quality joins">
                    
                    <p class="small-text">Floating Panel &amp; Frame Doors  •  Mortise &amp; Tenon  •  100lb. Full-Length Drawer Glides  •  English Dovetail Drawers  •  Fully Finished 360 Degrees</p>
                     
                    <h2>Personalize or Customize</h2>
                    <p>From the changing of finish stain color, adding table leaves, to creating your own custom table size, we can handle almost any type of custom request. We promise to keep the process simple, and put the focus on providing great quality furniture!</p>
                    <img class="center" src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/img/sizing.jpg" alt="Make your table the size that you want it">
                    
                     
                    <h2>Conrad Grebel Guard Finish</h2>
                    <p>After applying your stain color, we finish each piece with our Conrad Grebel Guard(tm) finish. This catalyzed varnish finish provides a harder and more durable surface than traditional lacquer-based finishes. This finish helps protect your furniture from everyday spills and accidents. Conrad Grebel Guard will also resist water, alcohol, warm dishes, and even nail polish remover!</p>

                    <h2>Our Lifetime Guarantee</h2>
                    <p>We warrant our furniture for a lifetime against joint failure and 5 full years against any natural defects.</p>
